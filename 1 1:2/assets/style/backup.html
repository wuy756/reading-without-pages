			A few weeks passed on my mom’s journey of job searching. My dad came home one night and slammed the door behind him. 

			<br>
			“Mama leh?” Where’s mom?
			<br>
			<br>
			He didn’t answer me. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I watched as the clock ticked away. Half an hour had passed. Where was she? Why was nobody concerned? My head started to go there, you know THERE, what if she got into an accident? What if someone kidnapped her? With no time to waste, I grabbed my umbrella, put on my outdoor shoes, and took it upon myself to embark on a journey to find my lost mother. 
			<br><br>
			It was one of those rare days in SF where it was pouring so hard you’d get instantly soaked. I almost missed it from all the fog, but about half a block down on 31st and Rivera, I saw the little green toyota. I lifted my umbrella and saw her sitting alone in the driver’s seat. Just sitting.
			<br><br>

			*knock*
			<br><br>
			Mama? Mommy?
			<br><br>
			*knock again*
			<br><br>
			She noticed me and quickly wiped away the tears streaming down on her face. 
			<br><br>
			“Ah! Yeeling!”
			Yu Ling. 
			<br><br>
			“Mommy? Can you open the door?”
			<br><br>
			Neh jo mut yeh ah? Nei jow lei jow mut jeh?”
			Yu Ling, what are you doing? How did you find me?
			<br><br>
			“Well, you didn’t home after dad. So I just wondered where you were.”
			<br><br>
			“Oh. Did you eat yet?”
			<br><br>
			“Yeah. I had rice. You?”
			<br><br>
			“No not yet.”
			<br><br>
			“Why are you here mom?”
			<br><br>
			“Heeh? Mo ah. Gui jum ma.”
			Oh it’s nothing. I’m just tired. 
			<br><br>
			We sat in silence. The rain beating hard against the glass. I watched as she closed her eyes and rested her head on the wheel. 
			<br><br>
			“Why don’t we go home?”
			<br><br>
			“Oh. Dung siu siu la. Mo bah jeh. Dung kuy lok yoon yu seen la.”
			Oh. Maybe in a little. I don’t have an umbrella. I’ll wait until the rain lets up a bit.
			<br><br>
			“I have one. I brought one down.”
			<br><br>
			“Hai nei ah. Jing hai nei lei wun ngo jah, ah Yeeling.”
			You’re the only one that came looking for me, she said. 
			<br><br>
			That night, I saw mommy more. I saw her not as a hero, or a villain, but just as my mom. Someone who worked. Someone who was tired.
			<br><br>
			I have to admit, our nights at Cornerstone Academy is where we made magic happen. And I know the other kids can’t grasp what I mean when I say you’re a custodian but it doesn’t matter because I do. “Oh your mom’s a pediatrician? That’s cool. But my mom? My mom works the late night shifts at Cornerstone Academy. She’s like…the Batman of San Francisco. They use the Ying Ying Chen signal whenever there’s a crisis. She’s the only one brave enough to scrape the shit out of the toilet bowls and pick the dry boogers you smash under your desks. Oh, your mom just won a literary award? That’s amazing. My mom may not get recognized for the work she does, but she’s the reason you come back to a lemon scented, dust free, skid-mark free school every morning.” My mom is so busy cleaning up other people’s messes, she hasn't even had a chance to sit back and admire her own beautification of the world.
