		<p>“Oh my god, Yu Ling. Let’s do this, it’s so easy and we’d so win.”</p>

		<p>Anna scooted her laptop towards me. It read “Sexual Assault Awareness poster contest”. Under it, a little line that said sponsored by the NYPD (New York Police Department). </p>

		<p>My response was immediate. Fuck no. </p>

		<p>I cackled a bit. How ironic that the NYPD was putting out a call for poster submissions for sexual assault awareness when just a few weeks ago I read that two police officers assaulted a young woman in custody. Here they are attempting to encourage people to call the police in a case of sexual violence. Like the wise philosopher Alanis Morisette said, isn’t it ironic?</p>

		<p>Then I saw the following line. </p>

		<p>$2500 prize.</p>

		<p>Then I thought…mayhaps.</p>

		<p>I searched up the past winners and saw the same bullshit perpetuated. Images of women being suffocated, silenced, or abstractly tortured with tag lines like “Speak Up” or “CALL NOW”. Alright, if I were to design something, maybe I could change the language that surrounded this issue.</p>

		<p>I sat with it for a bit. I felt guilty for contradicting my politics, but I also thought it might be worth some effort to make something that could shift the perception around this. I didn’t realize how difficult it was to actually think about making something that operated outside of the imagery commonly associated with sexual assault. After a bit of brainstorming, I landed on the phrase “You Have the Power” (to end sexual violence), it can start with a call. It felt kind of icky…urging people to call. But a few minutes later I exported it as a PDF and hit the send button. </p>

		<p>About two weeks later, I got an email. </p>

		<p>“Congratulations”. </p>

		<p>I fucking won. </p>

		<p>I mean first thing I did was laugh. How did I even scam my way into that? BUT GET THIS. They were formally inviting me to the police headquarters to receive my check and to be honored in a ceremony. Kind of dramatic. I had a friend tell me to not go. Why would I put myself in that position? But then I had another friend who said, you must. </p>

		<p>I weighed the two for a bit and ultimately decided to attend. If I could be in the room full of police officers and spew my shit to them where they wouldn’t be able to run away, maybe it would mean something. Or perhaps I was just trying to justify my curiosity. </p>

		<p>I RSVP’ed to the event with no guests to accompany me. I guess this was because I couldn’t find anyone enthusiastic enough to attend. They told us in the email the event was business formal. The morning of, I threw on an all black ensemble, partially because that’s New York’s uniform, but also because I am always mourning. </p>

		<p>I checked the RA office like I usually do to get mail. Meg was in there and I told her about this whole situation. She cackled. “I just think it’s funny that the NYPD is paying you for this.”</p>

		<p>“TRUE! But I want to at least do something to…you know…cause a bit of a ruckus. Like if I could wear something to show I am not a fan of them.”</p>

		<p>Meg got up and told me to hang on tight. A few moments later, she walked back to the office with her button maker. I printed out some images and in seconds we had a Black Lives Matter pin. I pinned it onto the lapel of my blazer. Small enough to make you notice. But kind of bold to be honest. </p>

		<p>“Meg, how do you just have a button maker with you?”</p>

		<p>“Well, you can’t have a revolution without a button maker.”</p>

		<p>It was cold out. Kind of foggy by the headquarters, which only added to the weird ominous feeling I had. It took me a while to find the damn place because it was in the middle of some plaza. Maybe that’s why it was called 1 Police Plaza. </p>

		<p>The line was empty. It was like airport security only you were in a room that had the mirrored windows that only the people on the other side could see through. </p>

		<p>“Wait until you are buzzed through.”</p>

		<p>I walked back and forth like a freaking idiot. They kept me waiting for what felt like forever. Fuck. What if they saw my pin and thought “not one of these”. I looked down at it, contemplating if I should just put it on when I entered the ceremony. Of course, that’s when they buzzed me in. </p>

		<p>Everything was so gray. I passed through the detector no problem. Probably because I was too anxious to bring anything other than a phone and an umbrella. </p>

		<p>“Hi! Uhm. It…uh, I’m here for the poster contest ceremony?” </p>

		<p>“The what?”</p>

		<p>“The uh—….”</p>

		<p>“Oh, follow me.”</p>

		<p>“Hello! How are you today?”</p>

		<p>I saw his eyes dart to my lapel.</p>

		<p>“Good. How are you?”</p>

		<p>“Good. You’re Yu Ling?”</p>

		<p>Why should I be surprised that they already know who I am and what I look like.</p>

		<p>“Yup!”</p>

		<p>“Alright, you’re headed up the stairs and you’ll be in the conference room all the way to the right!”</p>

		<p>I peeped my poster from the corner and did one of those peek in and sprint away as fast as you can moments. FUCK! They saw me. So I went in there and was immediately greeted by a white man in a fancy suit. They already had a seat for me with my name on it. </p>

		<p>A mother and her two daughters. A father and mother. A picture of their daughter, framed. She was studying abroad in Germany and couldn’t be here. Ah, I see. Me. A bunch of white men. Fruit. Bottled water. And a cookie platter. </p>

		<p>“Congratulations”, they all said as they came up to me.</p>

		<p>“Fhanks sew mach,” I said with shit in my mouth. </p>

		<p>They were very nice. Nice to the point where I was creepily suspicious.</p> 

		<p>Butthole clenching. A lot of it. Not sure if it was me or who but the tension was there alright. This was the room they held all the important meetings when there was a crisis happening in the city. What counts as a crisis to them, I wonder. </p>

		<p>Anyways, there was some awkward mingling and more talk about this and that. Everyone studied the posters immensely, as if there was something to be discovered over and over again the longer we looked. </p>

		<p>Finally, a man came in with some kind of chief officer. He sat down next to me and I saw the envelopes. I’m guessing that was my money.</p> 

		<p>They started to announce the winners one by one. They said this year was the first year it was all female winners. Female…interesting choice of word. </p>

		<p>We went up one by one to take pictures with these random police officers. They didn’t even tell us who they were, we were just there for a photoshoot, really. I got my check and my framed poster. Everyone kept coming up to me and making me pose with more people that I quite honestly did not care for. I made sure my frame was low enough to showcase the pin. It was interesting that they didn’t feel the need to get me to take it off, though that would probably cause an issue anyway.</p> 

		<p>At one point, I went around the room to speak with some of these men. The guy who wrote my check struck up conversation, so we got into a bit about how the poster contest started.</p>

		<p>“That’s nice. But what are you guys going to do about the actual culture of the police? What about the relationship between the young and police?”</p>

		<p>Silence. </p>
			
		<p>“Well, we just need these victims to step forward so that we can begin helping them. I know it’s stigmatized, but the more people that come out, the more we can help.”</p>

		<p>That wasn’t what I asked, but okay.</p> 

		<p>“No, she means that the kids don’t trust the police.”</p>

		<p>Exactly. </p>

		<p>He didn’t have an answer for me, and people in the room laughed. I said I would be open to bridging this conversation and seeing how we can hold officers accountable. They agreed. I got three business cards that day.</p> 

		<p>“It’s always the artists that get conversations going!” </p>

		<p>Is it? Maybe I’m just palatable to them. </p>

		<p>I walked out of that building feeling equally as uncomfortable, but kind of accomplished. I didn’t write them a letter like I had promised myself, and I didn’t yell or scream like I felt like I should have. But, I slipped those three cards into my wallet and got on the subway with a slight sense of motivation. </p>

		<p>The first thing I did was rip off the name tag they gave me and deposited my check. </p>

		<p>I cackled once more. </p>

		<p>The NYPD just wrote me a check for $2,500. </p>

		<p>The next day, I see on the news that the NYPD has just shot and killed a black man holding a pipe in Brooklyn. He was known around the neighborhood and was also bipolar. </p>
